Uniprot API

UniProt is a freely accessible database of protein sequence and functional information, many entries being derived from genome sequencing projects. It contains a large amount of information about the biological function of proteins derived from the research literature.
Since this is a very large data base, access of information can be a burden especially when information of more than one accession number is wanted.
