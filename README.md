# ProtAPI
This a python 2.7 API for several DataBases-NCBI's geo and nucleotide, RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Uniprot.
The API uses rest-API for querying and retrieving data.
The API parses the xml based data with Biopython for nucleotide, manually for PDB and Uniprot, and BeautifulSoup4 for GEO and SRA.
